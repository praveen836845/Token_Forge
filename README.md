![TokenForge Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/placeholder/banner-image.png)

**TokenForge** is a no-code token launcher that enables users to deploy their own SUI tokens in just a few clicks — without writing a single line of code. Built on the Sui blockchain, TokenForge is designed for creators, communities, and builders looking for an easy and secure way to onboard users with custom tokens.
